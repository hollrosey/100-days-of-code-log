Today I spent time planning a Scratch game with Igor Silva and Hiron Anakapalli for our first School Of Code Hackathon! Really excited to get back to it tomorrow, it‚Äôll be interesting to see how our initial plan unfolds.

## [Day 2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7161777920942755842-nuwk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
This morning we had a really insightful talk from Ira Rainey, lots of great takeaways and points to consider. 
We also finished off our Scratch game today and presented it! 
It was a great end to the first week at School of Code, highly looking forward to delving into JavaScript and software engineering next week.

## [Day 3](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7162183463788343296-saqK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Delving into the world of JavaScript again today with freeCodeCamp‚Äôs RPG project. It‚Äôs been a fun and interactive experience while also helping to cement some of the fundamentals.

## [Day 4](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7162501796119130112-7Ll4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Continuing my JavaScript practice today with freeCodeCamp and Learn JavaScript. It‚Äôs been really interesting to see how all of the basics work and how I can put them into practice, I look forward to building with JavaScript very soon!

## [Day 5](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7162904259527708672-h9Wd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Today has mostly been playing around with functions and solving some ‚Äòcustomer service tickets‚Äô which has been a really fun and interactive way to explore! Although these two functions are very simple, I‚Äôm proud that I‚Äôm able to understand them inside and out.üòÑ

## [Day 6](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7163255731457097730-yl39?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
A day can really make so much difference! We‚Äôve been working on objects and arrays today, I feel much more confident with them after tonight‚Äôs practice. 

A snippet of todays objects practice, very proud of my progress today!

## [Day 7](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7163621251696050176-LXN1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
We practiced a lot of debugging today which was great fun, I really enjoyed the process of going through code line by line to discover why it doesn‚Äôt work. 

I‚Äôve spent some of the evening trying to get to grips with array methods and callbacks, I think it‚Äôll take a little time to get the hang of these but I‚Äôm starting to understand the logic. Sticking with it!

## [Day 8](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7163963318578188289-5QdG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
It‚Äôs that time of the week again, Hackathon prep has begun. Rebekah Anderson, Aparna Abbina and I have managed to get a solid plan in place and complete an MVP for our JavaScript Rock, paper, scissors game. 

It‚Äôs been a challenging yet rewarding second hackathon, lots of fun challenges to navigate but we‚Äôve been equipped with lots of knowledge to face them head on. 

Tomorrow we‚Äôll get chance to refine our game, add new features and plan for our presentation. All in all, feeling like a very successful Hackathon alreadyü•≥

## [Day 9](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7164343934452781056-fkqs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Another Hackathon complete! Our rock, paper, scissors game evolved to include lizard and Spock today.üòÇ Shoutout to my wonderful teammates Rebekah Anderson and Aparna Abbina, we did an amazing job in such a short time. 

We had time to create a very basic html file so that we could build clickable buttons to make our game playable in our page rather than in the prompts we had initially planned yesterday so although we didn‚Äôt get to include username input, I believe we achieved a great result!

## [Day 10](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_how-to-think-like-a-programmer-activity-7164698768553041921-mAQl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
I took the time today to watch the ‚ÄúHow To Think Like A Programmer‚Äù seminar today, it had a lot of great ideas packed into the hour and Andy Harris is a great and engaging speaker. 

‚ÄúThe secret isn‚Äôt code. The secret is algorithms and data‚Äù is definitely a mindset that‚Äôs mirrored by School Of Code, as is writing the algorithms in plain English before converting to code. Now to put these ideas into practice!

## [Day 11](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7165049836268974080-K4MS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
This afternoon was spent recapping functions, arrays and objects. The more I practice, the more that the syntax clicks into place. I can‚Äôt wait for JavaScript to be natural to me, practice makes perfect! 

Very excited to see what next week brings; a new team, new challenges and new struggles but that‚Äôs where the learning happens.üôåüèª

## [Day 12](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7165378251081646082-CTOm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
It‚Äôs the start of a new week at School of Code and that means meeting new teammate Stacie Tilsleyü•≥ we‚Äôve spent the day learning about DOM trees and started to look at manipulating the DOM.

I also want to feature a project I built over the weekend, a Magic Eight Ball.üé± 
Although the code behind it is very simple, I‚Äôm proud of this build and I can‚Äôt wait to create bigger and better projects. It was a simple first look at DOM manipulation and made today a bit less of a huge leap. 

Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think!

## [Day 13](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7165772021862264832-n2Q4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Another day of practicing DOM manipulation and using event listeners in practical challenges. I‚Äôm really proud of our team and how well we did on these challenges through trial and error!

This afternoons study session consisted of finishing the DOM challenges workshop and reviewing an app ready for tomorrows fetch API workshop.üëè

Very thankful to have such a supportive and lovely bunch in cohort 16, there‚Äôs never a dull moment.ü•∞

## [Day 14](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7166140244931674112-mI3t?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Today, Nadeem Shabir and Elly Durrant kicked off our bootcamp with a captivating talk! Their insights into what awaits us after graduation were fascinating, especially learning from Elly's journey as a bootcamp success story. Hearing about the challenges and rewards we‚Äôre going to face really ignited my excitement for the weeks ahead!üëè

Into the afternoon, we were tackling the fetch API workshop. By the end of the day we did get the Dad Joke App up and running; it just took a lot of trial and error, and we could definitely do with making a cleaner function, but we‚Äôre happy that we did it and can‚Äôt wait to improve it.ü•≥

## [Day 15](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7166512236163772416-e0mE?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Hitting the ground running this morning with some brain-teasing Codewars challenges and an in-depth data retrieval and API workshop to hone our technical skills.

Today also brought great insights from Joseph Trodden‚Äôs session covering personalities and team dynamics. Understanding different personality types and strengths helped me envision how I can best contribute to diverse and collaborative environments.

Finally, time to prepare for another hackathon! I'm excited to put my technical skills to the test and collaborate with my team to come up with a dynamic weather app. Sneak peek below- no JavaScript yet.üëÄ

## [Day 16](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7166849596445437952-vj3N?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Just finished an intense week with Hackathon number 3, building a weather app with the wonderful Stacie Tilsley and Josh Whillock. While our app was far from perfect, the learnings (and laughs!) were worth their weight in gold. 

Our key takeaway was the power of having solid pseudocode. Although our initial MVP plan was in-depth, planning out the app‚Äôs logic more meticulously with pseudocode would‚Äôve saved us from quite a long debugging session. While our app still needs some polish, we truly learned so much and I can‚Äôt wait to apply these skills to other projects. 

We pushed ourselves, collaborated and had so much fun in the process. Big thanks again to Stacie and Josh, looking forward to the next challenge!

## [Day 17](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7167177952688852992-KZvu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
This weekend‚Äôs task is practicing async/await and fetching APIs, I‚Äôve chosen to attempt to build a Pok√©dex.üòÖ

I‚Äôve planned it out twice before, neither of which were detailed enough and left me with more questions than answers. After a lovely Zoom call with Erin Smith, I‚Äôm feeling much more confident and I‚Äôm back on track. She helped me to realise that it‚Äôs okay to feel unsure about how to write everything myself, the fact that I can read and understand the code is enough for now. 

My final plan should hopefully now be detailed enough to enable me to make the app without looking up every little detail, just googling the basic structures when I‚Äôm unsure. I used a coding tutorial and wrote each step in plain English in the hopes that I can complete the code without looking at it. Even just taking the time to read and understand their code was beneficial to my understanding.

## [Day 18](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7167514551314280448-_JCv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Using the comments I made yesterday with the tutorial code, I was successfully able to replicate a working Pok√©dex! I even added a button to toggle between their regular form and shiny form.üòé

I spent the morning styling and debugging, making sure that I have something that looks the part and works well too. I‚Äôm overall really happy with how it turned out and I can‚Äôt wait to use these techniques again in future builds! 

Massive thank you to Erin Smith and Timothy Bridge for all the supportive calls, messages and feedback, it really boosted my confidence with this project. Teamwork really DOES make the dream work.üòÇ

## [Day 19](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7167951969288994816-ZdUC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Week 4 of School Of Code, new teammates and we‚Äôre learning all things Back End! 

We started the day with an exercise in planning our code for other teams to follow which was (sort of) a success! The team following our instructions got the same code that we did even though our answer ended up being wrong so it still felt like a successful plan was created.

Our afternoon consisted of all things node.js, which was my first look at anything related to back end engineering. I‚Äôll definitely need to read more around everything we went over today as it was so much new information. All in all, an exciting day!

## [Day 20](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7168332480482144256-X5R4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm 20 days into this challenge already! We continued into the world of backend development with Express.js today. With such a flexible framework, I‚Äôm so excited by the possibilities of future builds! It‚Äôs also very intuitive so it should be great for us who are just starting our journey into full stack development. 

We covered a lot of ground today and I‚Äôll be taking the evening to read around topics and relax ready for another full day tomorrow.

## [Day 21](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7168683611662053377-qkre?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
We started the day with a brilliant talk from Nadeem Shabir and Alex Cooper about designing and building RESTful APIs; it felt like a great foundation for the day ahead where we explored creating an API and hosting it on our computer. 

With the HTTP methods workshop, we didn‚Äôt quite get to using DELETE but we got try out GET, POST and PUT with plenty of planning before coding. It really does make a huge difference!

## [Day 22](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7169054732357984256-lOgQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Continuing from yesterday, we worked on more HTTP requests and working with APIs which has been excellent practice for our Hackathon tomorrow where we will build a RESTful API.ü•≥

With most of the planning completed today, we should be able to get stuck in with the build tomorrow. I‚Äôm excited to see what our team creates!

We also had another mindset workshop today with Joseph Trodden, focusing on listening, the types of listeners and how to improve the way that we listen in order to improve teamwork. It‚Äôs given me a lot of food for thought for the upcoming week!

## [Day 23](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7169394596391686145-NCoo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
It‚Äôs the end of week 4 at School of Code and we spent the day creating and presenting our Hackathon APIs! Massive thank you to Gavin Persad and Stephen Boyce, we made a great team.

Our planning felt solid this week and while we only managed to fully complete our get request, we learned a lot about how HTTP requests work!

Thank you to any bootcampers that filled out an object for our array too, we couldn‚Äôt have done it without you!üòÑ

## [Day 24](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7169817099425546240-j6r7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Having a good rest this weekend ready for another week of learning but I couldn‚Äôt help but practice creating an API this morning. Haven‚Äôt quite got everything up and running yet but I‚Äôll be revisiting it tomorrow to cement what we learned last week! Even rest days have some tinkering to be done here and there.üòÖ

## [Day 25](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7170111041681494016-dFZy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Todays focus has been preparing for the week ahead: the Database Engineer Experience. Watching videos from ‚ÄòCBT Nuggets‚Äô about databases, the technologies that they use and focusing on SQL. 

I‚Äôm already excited to learn more about how databases can shape our personal lives as well as the workplace!

## [Day 26](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7170492954342592514-kebV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
We spent the day solidifying APIs and HTTP methods ready for when we start work on databases today. I found a lot more of the concepts were clicking today after a break at the weekend which is very satisfying! 

I‚Äôm working on the Recipe API task this evening, currently debugging my patch request by checking it line by line before I can start work on my delete request.

## [Day 27](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7170875214178799616-_oK5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Diving straight into SQL today with SQLBolt; a fun and interactive way to explore the new syntax. Interacting with the database turned out to be much more intuitive than I expected and the simpler SQL queries came naturally! 

I can‚Äôt wait to start building databases of my own with the knowledge we build this week, I already have an idea for an app that would greatly benefit from a database instead of keeping the data in files.üí°

## [Day 28](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7171223252353171456-M98N?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Continuing our exploration of SQL today by kicking off the day solving a SQL murder mystery. It was a great way to warm up and practice our syntax ready for the workshop this afternoon where we put it all into practice with our own database. 

We managed to get a decent portion of the workshop completed before the end of the day, teamwork makes the dream work, a continued theme of the course!

## [Day 29](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7171621150026899456-Uivx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
A day of Codewars, databases and another wonderful mindset session today! Making plenty of progress with planning for katas in Codewars and being able to solve them much faster and more efficiently. 

The database practice was great for setting up for tomorrows Hackathon, I can‚Äôt wait to get stuck in! 

As for the mindset session, we had lots of great insights into impostor syndrome, our inner critic and our inner champion. My takeaway is to actively try to listen to my inner champion more often.

## [Day 30](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7171896768253669377-vnCo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Another successful Hackathon Friday! Huge thanks to Andy Newbould and Ayodimeji Akinbolude for being fantastic teammates this week.

We built a working films and actors API using PostgreSQL. Users can request data about individual actors or films. By focusing on a simple data structure, we finished the project efficiently, allowing for in-depth debugging.

This hackathon was a valuable learning experience, especially as we only started learning SQL earlier this week. I'm excited to keep practicing with databases throughout the weekend!

## [Day 31](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7172278528741228544-1Zb_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
My preparation for next week is complete as I've hit 300 honour in Codewars. It‚Äôs been quite the challenge, but thorough planning and perseverance definitely made things easier. 

By challenging myself to take on katas that are more difficult than my current kyu rating, I‚Äôve been able to get honour much quicker than I expected while also practicing lots of technical concepts in the process.

## [Day 32](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_introduction-to-sql-computer-science-activity-7172575286784438272-h6xe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Since I‚Äôve hit my Codewars honour target ready for next week, I‚Äôve spent the morning watching (and rewatching) Socratica‚Äôs Introduction to SQL playlist on YouTube. 

We covered some of these videos earlier in the week but revisiting everything helped solidify my understanding and identify areas that might need extra focus.

## [Day 33](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7173048890546442240-eNFH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Today marks the start of the Quality Assurance Engineer at School of Code and so far, I‚Äôve really enjoyed it! 

Our workshop for the day was my first time writing automated tests to check software and it felt surprisingly intuitive, I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring these concepts further as the week goes on.

## [Day 34](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7173420061792133120-ifxz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Day two of quality assurance and we focused on testing strategies and TDD. I‚Äôm really enjoying writing tests before the code as I feel it‚Äôs an even more in depth way to plan, even though it‚Äôs taking me some time to adjust to this new way of thinking! 

We also enjoyed a guest talk from Loupe Testware, who offered great insights into the world of QA and how our skills from the bootcamp could transfer to a business.

## [Day 35](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7173735566050496513-aj4i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Kicked off the day with a fantastic talk from Nadeem Shabir and Darren Arbon, diving into all aspects of testing and gaining valuable insights on how our skills translate to real-world businesses. Feeling incredibly lucky to learn from such industry experts!

Building on yesterday's learnings, we delved into an API testing workshop followed by an End-to-End Testing workshop with Playwright. Particularly enjoyed the code generation process with the VS Code extension and I‚Äôm excited to put it into practice. Putting these new concepts into practice definitely presented some challenges, but that‚Äôs where the learning happens!

## [Day 36](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7174138778016468995-GzIi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
More TDD practice for me this afternoon and this evening for our Hackathon: creating our own Codewars kata! I‚Äôm really excited to get cracking tomorrow but for now, I‚Äôm practicing creating tests on my old projects to really solidify my understanding of the different testing processes. Although we won‚Äôt be using Playwright in our Hackathon, it‚Äôs been great to see how it works and to get a better understanding of the syntax.

## [Day 37](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_codewars-achieve-mastery-through-coding-activity-7174432695458914306-y590?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
This week, we faced our first solo challenge with creating our own Codewars katas. It's been a journey filled with hurdles and breakthroughs, but overall, it‚Äôs been so much fun.

Huge shoutout to my incredible teammates Eloise Cresswell and Reeha Choudhury for your constant collaboration, encouragement and support, even during our individual challenges. The week has flown by thanks to their positive energy and collaborative spirit, it‚Äôs infectious!

I also want to say a massive thank you to Erin Smith for her unwavering support throughout the whole course so far and also to Timothy Bridge for taking time out of his day to lend a hand yesterday. 

While technical skills are crucial, the friendships and teamwork forged on this journey are truly priceless.

Although my kata was unfortunately retired pretty quickly, I thoroughly enjoyed the creative process and will share it here for anyone who wants to see.

## [Day 38](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7174837631107616770-2IeM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Practicing some basics today with HTML and CSS, focusing on layout mainly. It‚Äôs been nice to have a refresher on grid and flex, exciting to get back to some front end work next week! 

I‚Äôve saved my media query practice for tomorrow, keeping it in the forefront of my mind ready for Monday.

## [Day 39](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7175135903978270720-tB_y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
I‚Äôve spent some time reviewing media queries today ready for our Web Engineer Experience starting tomorrow! I feel quite comfortable with the majority of front end so revisiting them has been a nice way to refresh my memory ready for the next couple of weeks. I‚Äôm really looking forward to getting started tomorrow!

## [Day 40](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7175555683709263875-p-XA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
New week, new team, new challenges! Kicking off week 7 with a fantastic refresher workshop on responsive web design and media queries, it really solidified the basics of grid and flexbox for me. It was so rewarding to see the website come together! While we still have some basic CSS styling to tackle, we're incredibly proud of what we accomplished.

Looking forward to diving headfirst into React tomorrow after tonight‚Äôs prep work, it‚Äôll be interesting to start to create our own components!

## [Day 41](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7175890634593947648-CT9q?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Today we created our first ever React components by converting the website we created yesterday. It was a really simple process and our group took to it really well, I‚Äôm very excited to try Next.js tomorrow with more advanced React!

## [Day 42](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7176275575869730816-GsGr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Today we translated our Fireplace Palace website from Vite to Next.js and learned a ton about React States in the process. This move will help us to create a more dynamic and user-friendly website. We didn‚Äôt get to populating our ‚Äòfounders‚Äô page today so I don‚Äôt have anything new to share visually but really proud of our progress and problem-solving today!

## [Day 43](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7176612882229407744-RTaq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Continued our work on the toggle button from yesterday and started work on our Hackathon: adding a new component that uses an API to fetch review data. 

Our team is in a really good position this week as we‚Äôve been problem-solving very effectively, everything is taking shape nicely. I‚Äôm excited to get this hackathon complete, another under the belt!

I‚Äôve putting together a basic founders page this afternoon as we didn‚Äôt quite have time to finish it yesterday (sneak peek below), there‚Äôs still more work to be done but we‚Äôre mostly caught up ready for tomorrow!

## [Day 44](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7176977042935050241-o4N_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Another wonderful week at School of Code wrapped up with a brilliant hackathon. I‚Äôm so thankful for my teammates Annamaria Koutsoras and Gabrielle Mia who have made this week such a pleasure, easily one of my favourites to date!

We covered responsive web design, dove head first into React with components, useState, useEffect and we also learned a lot about Next.js this week. I‚Äôll spend some time over the weekend reviewing and hopefully mastering the concepts we covered this week. 

Our hackathon challenged us to build upon our responsive webpage and have it fetch reviews from an API. We collaborated like a dream and ended up with a fantastic final product! Super proud of what we accomplished!

## [Day 45](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_100daysofcode-activity-7177401967743250433-18pr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
React revision today with react.gg! The more visual and interactive explanations have been great for helping me to understand what we‚Äôve covered this week and will hopefully cement my knowledge. 

Tomorrow I‚Äôll be looking over React and Next.js again in preparation for more next week!

## [Day 46](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hollrosey_learn-react-with-this-one-project-activity-7177774224709668865-10g0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):
Following in Erin Smith‚Äôs footsteps, I‚Äôm revisiting React with Web Dev Simplified. It‚Äôs been brilliant for revisiting the fundamentals and getting a firm grasp of the basics ready for the week ahead!

We started our day with a fantastic talk from Felicity Cullen! Her honesty and encouragement when sharing her experience as a bootcamp grad were truly refreshing and encouraging. It's so valuable to learn from others on the same journey.

Back to our Fireplace Palace project this afternoon and we've been creating a contact form that is linked on the homepage. We had a really successful day, getting our form completed and working so that it logged our input to the console, we just need to finish styling it!

Today felt like a great step towards understanding more about React. This afternoon will be more self study, particularly looking at reducers and how they manage complex state in React.

Our hackathon is starting a bit early this week due to the bank holiday so we‚Äôve had a full day to work on the Fireplace Palace form! 

Today, we made a lot of progress, starting by converting our useStates to reducers. This switch will help us manage our application state more efficiently as the project grows.

After, we‚Äôve been addressing error handling, success messages and more. Looking forward to showcasing our site tomorrow!

Thrilled to have reached Day 50 of this challenge already! Today was Fireplace Palace Hackathon #2 and it was so much fun collaborating with Gabrielle Mia and Annamaria Koutsoras again this week. Their teamwork, dedication and commitment to our projects has been invaluable and it‚Äôs been so rewarding to see it all come together! 

Here‚Äôs our final results, we‚Äôre absolutely thrilled with what we‚Äôve created over these past two weeks and we‚Äôve learned so much in the process.

I rewatched the Lama Dev video on useReducer and it made a lot more sense now that we‚Äôve used it in the hackathon this week. https://lnkd.in/epPvYhFe

It‚Äôs been nice to take a rest day, other than completing my learning audit for SoC and identifying areas that I need to revise further. I‚Äôve actually been pleasantly surprised on how much I‚Äôm retaining so the revision shouldn‚Äôt be too tough.üòÑ

Two days into the long weekend and I‚Äôm very much enjoying giving myself time to reflect on my journey so far and identifying areas where I can improve. 

I took some time earlier to read over some of the topics and learning resources from weeks 1-3 of the course as part of my learning audit so that I can better tailor my revision in the coming weeks.

Continuing on my learning audit and self reflection, I‚Äôve been reviewing weeks 4-6 today and reading over the learning resources that School of Code shared. It‚Äôs been a great way to get a high level overview of any gaps in my knowledge while also enjoying the down time. I must admit though, I‚Äôm ready to get back to building and problem-solving.ü§©

Final day of the long weekend today and I‚Äôve really appreciated the time spent relaxing and recouperating with my family! 

I spend a couple of hours reflecting over weeks 7 and 8 of the course which have been our most recent Web Engineer experience modules and have identified that these are areas I need to revisit in my learning first. Getting to grips with React and Next.js won‚Äôt happen overnight but, with enough practice, I‚Äôll be more comfortable in no time.ü§©

Started the day with a fantastic guest talk from Olivia Winteringham, which gave us great insights into the world of UI and UX ready for the week ahead! 

Following this talk, we jumped straight into understanding UI and UX principles and how different approaches can make or break a product or business. 

I‚Äôm looking forward to the week ahead, it will be exciting to work in another creative area of tech!

Started the day with some JavaScript practice on Exercism, I really enjoyed the way that the problems are phrased and it was great fun to get stuck in! 

We thoroughly explored the Design Thinking Framework to understand how it would impact the way that we design and build an end product. We created a questionnaire and interviewed potential users and, with this information, we crafted two user personas. I‚Äôm excited to see where the empathise and design stages that we completed today will take us tomorrow when we look at ideation.

Continuing with UI/UX week, we spent the day exploring wireframes and how they‚Äôre useful when creating an app. Using visual aids and creative tools is something I thoroughly enjoy so it‚Äôs been right up my street! 

I also continued my JavaScript practice on Exercism; I‚Äôm really loving their methods of creating engaging problems to solve and it‚Äôs helping me to make sense of the basics in ways I hadn‚Äôt thought of before.

Wow, it's hard to believe that it's been 100 days since I embarked on this coding journey! It's been an incredible experience filled with learning, challenges, and a ton of fun. School Of Code‚Äôs weekly internships have kept me on my toes, learning everything from UI/UX to APIs and databases; I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed this experience! 

I started out this journey with minimal coding knowledge and I'm truly blown away to see how far I've come. Of course, a huge shoutout to my fellow bootcampers for the support, shared struggles and all the laughs that made this journey even more rewarding.

Finishing Day 100 with some CSS and JavaScript animations for the final project and some contact form building on my own website, still plenty of work to be done.ü•≥
